This is a Flask web app project to learn more about flask, and hopefully be able to compare it to the 
Django project for components and ease of coding.

This project will create a web app of blog entry creations.

I want to learn how to create Python environments, use git for version control and sharing, flask framework, 
use of requirements.txt to set up exact deployment environments, and hopefully user registration and maintenance,
and web security within the flask app.
